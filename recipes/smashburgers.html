    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A mouthwatering classic smash burger is a culinary masterpiece that begins with perfectly seasoned, high-quality ground beef, typically sourced from a blend of chuck and brisket. The key to its irresistible allure lies in the cooking method - the beef is expertly smashed onto a sizzling hot griddle, resulting in a caramelized, crispy exterior that locks in all the juicy goodness. Nestled between a soft, toasted bun, this burger features a symphony of flavors, including melty American cheese, crisp lettuce, ripe tomato slices, pickles, and a slathering of creamy, tangy special sauce. With every bite, you'll experience a delightful balance of textures and tastes, making this classic smash burger an icon of indulgence and satisfaction.</p>
