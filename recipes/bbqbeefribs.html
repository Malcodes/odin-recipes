<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The most delicious BBQ beef ribs are a carnivore's dream come true. These succulent and tender ribs start with quality cuts of beef ribs, such as beef short ribs or beef back ribs, generously seasoned with a flavorful dry rub that combines a mix of spices, brown sugar, and smoky paprika. Slow-cooked to perfection over a wood or charcoal fire, the meat becomes fall-off-the-bone tender while developing a tantalizing smoky flavor. Basted with a mouthwatering, tangy barbecue sauce that's a perfect balance of sweetness and spice, these ribs are a true masterpiece of barbecue cuisine. With each bite, you'll experience the smoky aroma, the caramelized crust, and the juicy, savory meat that makes these BBQ beef ribs an irresistible culinary delight.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Beef ribs (short ribs or back ribs)</li>
    <li>Dry rub (a mix of spices, brown sugar, paprika, salt, and pepper)</li>
    <li>Barbecue sauce (a tangy and sweet sauce with ingredients like ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and spices)</li>
    <li>Wood or charcoal for smoking</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start by preparing the dry rub. In a bowl, mix together spices, brown sugar, paprika, salt, and pepper to create the rub.</li>
    <li>Generously coat the beef ribs with the dry rub, ensuring that each rib is well-seasoned. Wrap the ribs in plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
    <li>Prepare your smoker or charcoal grill for indirect heat cooking. Use wood chips or chunks to create smoke for that authentic smoky flavor.</li>
    <li>Once the smoker or grill is ready and the temperature is around 225-250°F (107-121°C), place the seasoned beef ribs on the grates away from the direct heat source.</li>
    <li>Cook the ribs low and slow, maintaining a steady temperature for several hours. The cooking time can vary but typically ranges from 4 to 6 hours, or until the ribs are tender and have a beautiful smoky crust.</li>
    <li>During the last 30 minutes of cooking, baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce, allowing it to caramelize and create a flavorful glaze on the meat.</li>
    <li>Remove the BBQ beef ribs from the smoker or grill when they are tender and the sauce is nicely set.</li>
    <li>Let the ribs rest for a few minutes, then slice them between the bones and serve them hot, with extra barbecue sauce on the side if desired.</li>
