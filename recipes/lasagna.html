        <li>Béchamel sauce</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat until they are fully cooked. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinara sauce to the cooked meat and simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, prepare the béchamel sauce by melting butter, adding flour to create a roux, and then whisking in milk until it thickens. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the desired temperature (usually around 350°F or 175°C).</li>
        <li>In a large baking dish, start assembling the lasagna. Begin with a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce, béchamel sauce, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and dollops of ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until you've used up all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the lasagna is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve your delicious homemade lasagna.</li>
      </ol>
